# 27/02/2025 - My Chemistry Exam
#abiba #exam
Ohk, I know that this shit is going to take fucktons of yapping but yeah here we go.
So as you guys know that there was a girl I met in my 12th Board practicals, her name was **Abiba Ansari** , So yeah i firstly saw her on the Physical Education Practical in her school (my school is a branch of that school so all branches went & gave practical on the main one) she was talking with Piyush (my classmate), tf was  happening, that nigga was talking with that girl, anyways, We both met again (irl) on Physics Practical & have our first Convo, she seemed talkative, We both talked a lot, I cracked some of lowkey jokes, We even went to the practical class together, and only us. btw my convo was good that day & the only thing I was regretting was that I'm never gonna see her again, one hope was real board exams.


##### Tonight!
I didn't slept the whole night, I well completed the Physical chemistry, and role learnt the inorganic chemistry, and for the organic chemistry, I've did nothing special, just saw lectures of 11th recap from Apni Kaksha YT Channel, (it didn't helped me in exam though) & watched a lecture of haloalkanes and haloarenes, and for the test of my time , I was basically wasting time.

##### Today!	
So today I was ready, to approach Abiba, & take her IG I'd as I couldn't manage to take it on previous worthy exam of Physics in which we both talked a lot & cheated, I went at the Exam center, met Sandeep, and handed him that Chemistry Cheetsheet, He read for a few seconds and then we both headed to see our sitting arrangement from a pasted Notice on the board outside the center.
I asked sandeep 'see mine, its ..868', he said yes, i asked for 865 cuz that was of Abiba, well for god's sake she was sitting beneath me, & at that time i was like 'hell yeah! Lets goo!'.

Then entry started, all of our classmates entered , and gathered at one place, they started yapping casual cringe, & then Ananya said 'Abiba aagayi Krish', I was blushing in my mind but i said "tf i'm gonna do with abiba?" , but they were like "Look! , She's looking (noticing) at you", I remained calm in the chaos, cuz I knew that I'll be sitting with her again , nothing special but today I'll do anything & ask her IG I'd, then I entered into the school building , went upstairs and to the washroom first cuz I had to pee, tf Im discusssing, btw then I found my classmates in room no. 48 & I was looking at Abiba from outside, my brain cells were like Cheers!, I was asking the invigilator "Maam, roll no ..868?", but my eyes were twirking around her & my bros, (I'm not that much simp).

##### I sat with her>
I sat, & as expected she asked "Padke Aye ho?", i said "Padhne ki baat kar rhi ho, me to so ke bhi nhi aya", I think she said "Kyu?" & I replied "chemistry padh rha tha, kuch prepare hi nhi hua fir bhi."
Then i discussed about the physics paper, that how hard it was, & then I cracked some lowkey jokes as usual & sarcastically pinched her (in flattery), I said "mere to aajaynege 20-30, tumhare bhi aa hi jaynege 50 se 60 ke bich me", she blushfully turned to me (I imagined my classmates sitting behind me & other students in the room, & was feeling awkward that i was the only guy who was ranting with a chick before exam time, cuz everyone else there was silent & nervous of Exam) and said "tumse to kam hi likha tha yaar", & then we continued...
& Then after a few talks I punched my revised dialogue "ByTheWay, are you on Instagram or somehing?" She said "matlab?" (Tf happened, I was clearly audible but maybe she didn't understood, but..) I said "Are Instagram vagera pe ho tum?", she said Ha, & i said "I'd do zara apni, let's get in touch", She said "Umm.. itz abiba..", I interrupted "Bich me underscore hai?", (I started writing it down on my admit card in a small font so that I should'nt gets into problems of writing something onAdmit Card cuz that was the only paper I took there with myself) She nodded, then I said ohkey and?, She said "its underscore abiba dash umm underscore..", (like tf was this girl, dont even know underscore?, even 0 on 10 baddies of my class know what is an underscore), she continued "Baad me acche se dedungi", she meant that she'll give me her id written afterwards the exam cuz copies were about to distributed & the aroma was tense there.

Exam Copies & Question Paper distributed, i saw that, fuxin hard for me, i somehow managed to answer some questions and i hope I'll get 30+ out of 70, so I'll get+30 marks of practical & it will become 60+ out of 100.

Ohk, she started asking me some MCQ in a low tone to not get caught, but the problem was , she was having different set of questions, some were same, but those she was asking weren't in mine one or i already skipped them in mind.
How tf I was supposed to answer her questions, okey , i answered the MCQ but for other questions i simply said 'ye mere set me nhi hai ' or "mujhe ye wala question nhi aarha, i skipped it", in the first 2 hours she was friendly with me & was sarcastically stressed that she wasn't attempting good in exam.
But in the last 1 hour of 3hour exam she started getting typical serious vibes, motionless, speechless & that 'ahhhh gosh' 'aghhhhh' 'ohh god....' vibes.

In the last I started finishing 5 marker questions, how tf I was supposed to help her , I'm not that much simp, I have my own life as well.

So after examiner took our copies : 

##### After Exam
Invigilator took our copies.
*I was desperately looking at her in a hope that she would turn, but she didn't* , cuz her friends who were sitting ahead her turned & came & met her instantly, she was from different school, she was having different friends, how tf I was supposed to disturb her.

I was about to give her my Question Paper like I did in physics exam & i would say her "Abiba, your IG I'd please"

But I couldn't manage to do it today.

##### Departure 
After 30 seconds of taking copies, we bros started leaving the classroom, Abiba still sitting on her desk talking with their friends was about to depart after next 15-20 seconds, but my bro's were saying "why u waiting, letts go outside" they didn't knew that.... Anyways so, around 25-25 student from each class, around 10 classes in a floor, started Heading downstairs from all 3-4 floors, i think when I was on the stairs of ground floor, she was on the stairs of 2nd floor, crowd emerged in the school ground from the school building, we left the building & in the ground archit was saying "bhai vo dekh Abiba", i said "mai kya achar dalu uska" while still finding where he was  pinpointing, btw I came at the gate, she was probably 20-30 meters away from me, I started going forward to the main gate, we could see the parents & media & crowd outside the school in the main gate, they all were waiting for us.

I was thinking either she will be having talks with her friends about "kitna hard tha na paper" or she'll be casually tryna noticing/finding me, as a last thought have came to her mind that uh oh "i forgot to give him my IG I'd ",

But bruh was Andrew Tate, he came home & wrote in his diary "If a women ignores you once, but you are in hope, FUCK THAT HOPE, get the fuck outta there. Go & cry alone, but if a single drop shred in front of that girl, then you are sucking your own dih" ~ [[Women Psychlogy]]

##### Future 
Three exams are left now, Maths , English and Hindi, she's from Bio Stream so I can meet her either on English or on Hindi too if she haven't chose C.S. over Hindi

But the problem is that if She'll come in any exam , she will not sit ahead of me directly, but The Row will be : Abiba -> Jay -> Komal -> Me, and basically Jay & Komal are my classmates but biggest red flag, i cannot take their help or do any act infront of them, they'll make my fun laterways.

So.... Help me GOD.

Eng exam update: I got lots of chances but still I became nhilistic, and didn't approached her, now there is 0.00001% chance in Hindi exam

Hindi exam update: Yes she came, but I got to know by my friend that she's a 6/10 so there's no point to approach her so i left her,  hopefully never gonna meet her again, basically I'll explain this some another day.

Peace Out
